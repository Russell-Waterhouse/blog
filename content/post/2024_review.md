# 2024's Winners and Losers

2024 is coming to a close, so I thought I'd
do a quick review of what tech I've used, what I've
liked, and what I didn't. 

## Favourite Project
my favourite project in 2024 has been my development environment
setup script: https://github.com/Russell-Waterhouse/dev_environment

With this at what I would consider to be an
alpha release, I'm already getting tons of
value out of it. I no longer need to add things
to one machine that I've already added to another. 
I no longer need to worry about borking my machine.
The workflow is exactly what I wanted.

## Favourite Tools of the year

This year I've moved from experimenting with languages
to building a set of tools that I constantly use. 

| Use Case | Tool |
| -------- | ---- |
| Run Simple Commands Often | Bash Scripting |
| Any script that requires logic or data structures | Python Scripting |
| Repeatable  Program Execution across environments | Docker |
| Systems Programming | TBD\* |

\* I'm still experimenting with different
systems programming languages. I'm using C++ to do
advent of code, and I'm building small web servers in 
C, C++, and Rust to try to compare all 3 languages. The issue I'm having right now is I don't have enough bandwidth to learn both rust and C++ and I would use them in different cases
