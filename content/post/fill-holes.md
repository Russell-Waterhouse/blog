# Fill the Holes in Your Knowledge

As a junior software engineer, you are pretty much guaranteed to be learning a
lot constantly, especially as you start. 

That's good. That's great even. On the job you'll inevitably be learning new
things with every ticket you take on. This is normal, as nobody comes out of
school or bootcamp or an online course knowing all that their first job is
going to expect of them. 

However, a few months in, or maybe sooner or later, you'll come to a point that
you realize you've got a good grasp on the day-to-day of your job. 

It's at this point you'll have to make a choice, though you might not realize
it.

The choice you have to make is whether or not to go back and fill in your
knowledge gaps. 


## My Own Example

When I first started my job at leanpub, I didn't know ruby at all. I went
through a few tutorials quickly in my first week, and absorbed a ton as I fixed
bugs and implemented features. Slowly but surely, I gained enough of a grasp of
the language and frameworks that I work in to be productive.  

However, I know there is still a lot about it that I don't know as well as I
should. I should know enough, intrinsically, about the language that I read and
write every day to do the Advent of Code day 1 without googling any syntax or
library calls, and I don't.  That's not because I've been a bad engineer, as
much as imposter syndrome would like to tell me that. 

It's just the nature of being a junior engineer. There will be holes in your
knowledge. 

Knowing that, when I get some down time, I've been working to fill those gaps.

I've started a repository of data structures, algorithms, and design patterns,
and I've started filling it out with the things that I want to master, going
back to the basics.

I've been working through the 2023 advent of code in Ruby, and after that I'll
do it in Haskell.


## Conclusion

Once you feel, as a junior engineer, that you're no longer drowning while
drinking from the firehose, go back and fill in the gaps in your knowledge. Go
back and learn those basics that you missed while fixing bugs and building
features. Learn the algorithms, learn the language features, learn the standard
libraries, and learn your frameworks.

Because that's what it takes to turn a junior engineer into a senior engineer.
