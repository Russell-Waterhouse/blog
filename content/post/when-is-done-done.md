# When is Something 'Good Enough'?

I introduced my last blog post with a short story, and I really liked how
that felt, so I'm going to do that again here. 

## A Short Story to Illustrate the Question

### Story 1: Hanger 
Imagine that you've gotten home from a long day at work. It was a long and hard
day, with many fires to be put out.   
You're tired.  
You're greasy.  
You're hangry.  

It's 9:30pm, and you haven't eaten since lunch at noon. You had planned to 
go grocery shopping after work at 5, but that just wasn't in the cards today. 
The grocery stores close at 10:00pm. Do you? 

- A) That Freezer pizza you keep for just such an emergency? 
- B) A 3-course feast with pork roast, tossed fresh salad, homemade salad dressing, and pumpkin pie?


Of course you eat that frozen pizza, because that's what the situation calls for. 


Sure, you could have done "Better." You could have had the home-cooked meal with
vegetables, homemade salad dressing, a little red meat to keep your iron up, and
some dessert for the soul. It would be healthier and tastier!

### Story 2: Royalty Visits
Imagine that you've somehow managed to convince the King of England to come to
your place for dinner. If it goes well, you're going to get a position as one 
of his aides. It's a good position that pays millions of dollars a year 
(remember, I said imagine). You've known that this dinner is happening for 
3 months, and you've had all of that time to prepare. What do you serve the King
of England? 

- A) That freezer pizza you keep for just such an emergency? 
- B) A 3-course feast with pork roast, tossed fresh salad, homemade salad dressing, and pumpkin pie?


Of course you do up the pork roast. The King would not be impressed with freezer
pizza, no matter how catchy the commercial jingle was. 

Sure, you could have done "Better". Freezer pizza is so much Cheaper!
And Faster! And Easier!

## The Question: Resource Allocation
There are several questions here, and I'll try to boil them down.  

What is considered "Good Enough"?  
What is considered "Better"?  
What is considered "Too Costly to Implement"?  

Usually, when I'm working with this problem day-to-day, the question looks 
something like this:   

*What problems require you to go the extra mile, and what do not?*  

All of these questions are kinda the same question, just wearing a different hat.

That's the question of Resource Allocation.

I have X resources, and I need to allocate them amongst Y jobs.
How many resources to I allocate to any specific task? 
How many resources is this task worth? 

First, we should note that for our little example, there were 2 ways to solve
the same problem: What to eat for dinner. But, we gave 2 different answers. 
This leads us to our first important point: 

*Solutions do not exist in a vacuum, their desirability is not absolute, but
instead it depends on how well it fits with the problem being solved.*
