# Learning Dvorak

About a week ago I started learning the dvorak keyboard layout. Below are my thoughts.


## Initial Motivations

It seems most people learn dvorak to type faster. From what I had found on the internet, there isn't much proof that an 
increase in typing speed is guaranteed.  Thus, while I believe in being efficient with my tools, 
this wasn't my incentive for learning this keyboard layout.  Instead, I learned it 
because I'm at the start of what I hope will be a very long and successful 
career as a software engineer, and I want to limit the risk of repeated-use 
injuries.


## Initial impressions

I didn't buy a new keyboard, instead I just switched my computer's keyboard layout in settings.

My first thoughts, after making the switch and learning the home row, was that this has the 
possibility to be really nice.  The way that many words that I was typing to learn the keyboard bounced
back and fourth between my hands felt really good.  While typing now required
a hundred times the focus that it did yesterday, I felt like the experiment was
worth continuing.


## Impressions After 2 Week

After about a week, I could type at a tolerable pace again. 
After about 2 weeks, I'm no longer thinking about what key to type, although
my fingers still make lots of mistakes so I'm still not as fast as I was on 
QWERTY.  For reference, I'm currently 40-45 wpm on dvorak and I was running
at about 70-80 on QWERTY. 

Of course, on top of learning the new keys for typing, I also have to re-learn
all of the keybindings and shortcuts. Copy, Paste, `ls`, vim motions, all of 
it has to be relearned.
