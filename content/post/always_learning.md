# Learning is a Journey that Never Ends
And with that in mind, I'm still trying to learn.  

## Learning Go
Go is a newer language that is all the buzz these days. I've heard great things from friends and peers, and now that I'm done my degree I have some time to 
learn it.   
I've been reading "Go Programming" by John P. Baugh, and while it's not the most recent or comprehensive book on the topic, I got it for free second-hand. 
Lastly, I've and started a project in Go to make use of what I learn. 
The project is available on Github here: [https://github.com/Russell-Waterhouse/RoboScan](https://github.com/Russell-Waterhouse/RoboScan)


## Honing my SysAdmin Skills
I've loved owning and maintaining my own systems. I already published content on how I run [an Ubuntu server that serves a nextcloud application](https://github.com/Russell-Waterhouse/selfhost_nextcloud), 
and I'll be making a full post about that soon here.   
Recently, I set up my own GitLab Runner to run CI/CD pipelines in GitLab on the same machine, which I've already gotten a ton of use out of.    
I've also acquired some hardware that I plan to turn into an OpenMediaVault server.   
I've also got a post coming down the pipe about setting up a new computer with Fedora 37, as I've just recently done that.  
Lastly, I've been gaining experience with some secret projects on Microsoft Azure. I'll be posting about that here when that project is more polished.
