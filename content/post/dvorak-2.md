# Dvorak Part 2

Like many Canadians, I recently went home for Thanksgiving. Among the 
turkey, the home repairs, and the excitement of a new kitten, I got 
asked to do some general IT work for friends and family. Unfortunately, my
nonstop use of the dvorak layout in the last 3 months has completely destroyed
my ability to work on a QWERTY keyboard.

For me, this is unacceptable. I need to be able to work on other people's 
computers. Anything that makes that slower, even if it only happens a few 
times a year, isn't something I can tolerate. My family runs a small 
business, and I do some of the IT work for it. I can't go installing dvorak 
on all those computers, and I cannot be so inefficient looking at the keys
all the time. 

So, as much as I believe that the dvorak layout is better, I'm going back to 
the QWERTY layout for the forseeable future. Maybe I'll get to a place where 
I can use both layouts interchangably, but considering how much I'm struggling 
to write this blog post, I doubt it. The good news is that my fingers didn't 
forget everything about this layout. I think I'll be able to pick it up again
much faster than I was able to learn a new layout.

So long, dvorak, it was fun while it lasted.
