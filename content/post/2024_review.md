# 2024's Winners and Losers

2024 is coming to a close, so I thought I'd
do a quick review of what tech I've used, what I've
liked, and what I didn't. 

## Favourite Project
my favourite project in 2024 has been my development environment
setup script: [setup script](https://github.com/Russell-Waterhouse/dev_environment)

With this at what I would consider to be an alpha release, I'm already getting
tons of value out of it. I no longer need to add things to one machine that
I've already added to another. I no longer need to worry about borking my
machine. The workflow is exactly what I wanted.

## Favourite Programming Languages of the Year

This year I've started putting HEAVY focus on using the right tool for the job,
and it has made programming far more enjoyable. Here are the languages I've
used the most this year:

| Use Case | Language |
| -------- | ---- |
| Run Simple Commands Often | Bash Scripting |
| General Scripting | Python Scripting |
| General Systems Programming (i.e. any program that isn't embedded programming or scripting) | TBD\* |


### \* Systems Programming
A few quick thoughts here about systems programming.

Originally what filled this space for me was Java (thanks university). However, there are a few
downsides to Java that make me want to move away from it.
1. It's interpreted, so it's not as fast as I'd like for this niche.
2. I find it uses far more memory than I'd like for this niche.
3. I find the "Java way" to be verbose at best and wasteful at worst.

Here's what I've experimented with so far, and my thoughts on each:

#### C++

I did 12 days of advent of code in modern C++. I like it a lot. Modern C++
appeals to many of my sensibilities as a programmer, and believe it's been
given far too hard a reputation. It's not as hard or verbose or bloated as
people make it out to be. Using C++ felt like working in a well-stocked shop.

Yes, there are many tools on the wall and in the drawers, some of them old,
some of them new. But when doing a project from scratch, just grab the tool you
need out of the toolbox and use it.

Yes, you do have to think about different things than you would in any other
programming language. That's true of all programming languages. I'm not
convinced I spent more time thinking about memory management in C++ than I
thought about JavaScripts' event loop or whitespace in Python. Every language
has some feature that you must be careful with. For some reason everyone seems
to think C++'s quirks are harder to deal with than other languages' quirks. I'm
unconvinced.

HOWEVER, that doesn't mean that C++ fits this niche for me. C++ has a range
unparalleled by any other language I've ever used. However, I would only want
all that range if I planned to use it all, and right now I'm just not working
on any projects that need the lower-level features of C++. Add to that fact the
reality that to get the performance
out of C++ that you would expect from C++, you have to be somewhat experienced
with it, and I'm not there and don't have the bandwidth to get there right now.
I'm a full-stack developer at a small startup, so here's what I've worked with
in the last month:
- React
- Vue
- Express
- Rails
- Postgres
- Redis
- MSSQL
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Terraform
- Azure
- Python
- Bash
- Perl
- CommonJS
- ES6
- R

Quite frankly, I don't have the time to get so good at C++ that I can use it
to its full potential.

#### Rust

I like the idea of Rust. However, for my use case it falls into the same pit
that C++ fell into above. Rust is complex, and you do need to be good at it to
use it to its full potential. I just don't have the time to get good enough
at Rust to make it worth it right now.

#### Go

I've been experimenting with Go for the last 2 weeks. I built a quick web
server on a plane ride with templ and HTMX, and I liked the experience. I read
a book on the programming language in about a day, and that appeals a lot to me.
If I can learn the syntax in a day, there's a good chance the overhead of gaining
and maintaining skill in the language isn't as heavy as C++ or Rust.

I'll be building a bigger project in Go to evaluate it further. 

## Favourite Development Environment of the Year
1. Neovim
2. TMUX
3. Fedora Linux

I completely re-wrote my development environment this year, and I'm very happy
with the results. I've been using a Neovim/TMUX combo for about 10 months now,
and I've never worked faster or felt more in-control of my environment.

Fedora Linux is just everything I think Linux should be: minimal, fast, with
decent defaults. I've used it for years and I've never had any problems.
