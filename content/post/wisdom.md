# My Favorite Quotes and Nuggets of Wisdom

In no particular order, here is every one of my favorite quotes, organized by
author.

As a disclaimer, just because I list an author here doesn't mean that I agree
with anything else the author has said. I believe that we can take good ideas
from everyone. If Hitler had a great doughnut recipe, I would use it.


## Alex Hormozi

"There are no silver bullets, only hundreds of golden BB's."

"Rather than picking up your next book,
take action on your last book."

"If you need perfect conditions to start it means your success is conditional.
If you want unconditional success, then be willing to start in under any
circumstance. That includes the one you’re in right now. "

"Entrepreneurship is about acquiring skills, beliefs, and character traits. To
advance, I find that we must determine which skills, beliefs, and character
traits we lack. Most times, we simply need to improve."

"Building a business is risky. Living paycheck to paycheck is risky.

Some risks come with upside. Others do not.

Risk wisely."


## Theodore Roosevelt

"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man
stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit
belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust
and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and
again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does
actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great
devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the
end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at
least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those
cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."

## Jordan Peterson

"Don’t hide baby monsters under the carpet. They will flourish. They will grow
large in the dark. Then, when you least expect it, they will jump out and
devour you."

## Greg James

"But problems are cowards and bullies, and they only take advantage if they
think they can win."

## Gregor Hohpe

"Excessive complexity is nature’s punishment for organizations that are unable
to make decisions."

## Henry Ford

"If you always do what you've always done, you'll always get what you've always
got."

## Niklaus Wirth

“Increasingly, people seem to interpret complexity as sophistication, which is
baffling – the incomprehensible should cause suspicion, not admiration."
