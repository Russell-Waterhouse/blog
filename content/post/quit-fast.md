# When, How, and Why to Quit Fast


In this article I'm going to be reflection on something that I've 
experienced a few times over the last few weeks and I want to 
formalize my thoughts on.


## What is Quitting Fast?

I'm not sure if there's another name for it elsewhere, but I call it quitting 
fast.  Quitting fast is the idea that as soon as you get an indicator that 
you're taking the wrong approach to a problem, quit that approach.


That's a little vague, so let me try to clarify. Say you're working on a 
new feature for your software, and you're unsure if you should take approach A
or approach B. They both seem about equally well suited to your use case on
paper, and both approaches are about equally popular.

Eventually, you make a decision and try it. An hour in, you find yourself 
frustrated with the workflow and ergonomics of the solution, so you 
go back and try approach B.  That's fast quitting.


## When to Quit Fast.

Fast quitting should be reserved for when you have other options. 

If you're deciding between solution A and solution B like in the example above,
that's an ideal time to fast quit. 

While that sounds like a very specific statement, it applies in far more 
places than you might expect. If your boss puts you on a mission-critical 
task that you find you're not qualified for, you should go back to your boss
and say, "Hey, I appreciate the vote of confidence here but I'm just not 
qualified for this.  If there was more time to complete it so that I could 
dive deep into learning the problem-space, or if it wasn't mission-critical, 
I would keep on trucking, but since it is, I think it would be wise to give it
to [Co-worker X, who is more qualified than you]


Then, your boss has all the information to make an informed decision. 
He or she may decide that you are the best resource for the job, despite the 
qualifications, or he or she may decide that you are right. 

Both are better than spinning your wheels on a problem for days before speaking
up.
