# Advent of Code 2023

![](/post/images/advent_of_code.png)

## First, a Short Story

Pretend you're me, a few months from now. You log into work at the startup 
that employs you, and you start working on yesterday's ticket. By chance, you
log into AWS console to test something. You notice something on your way to 
whatever service you needed to look at. 

```
COSTS UP 3482% COMPARED TO LAST MONTH
```

uhhh.... what? 

We should look at that.   
We should look at that now. 

`click click click`

Why has everything scaled so much? Our lambdas, our db cluster, everything? 
It's ... massive? 

Surely this is a mistake.  
You look at the most recent deployment. It fixes a typo in a translations file.   
You look at the second-most recent deployment. It's clean too. 

So, DDoS then? But wait, no, we use Cloudflare, we shouldn't get DDoS. 

Finally, you check google analytics. _Traffic is UP_

You check your analytics. Sales are up, new memberships are WAY UP. 

You check social media. Your biggest competitor went out of business, and
everyone is flocking to you and your service!

You've done it! You've actually done it! You and your team have 
crossed the infamous adoption chasm and it happened overnight! 

But your costs are still so high ...

And now you have to deal with it. You abandon whatever feature you were working
on and start profiling your product. You find 3 areas that are using WAY more
compute and memory than they should. Dutifully, you start trying to optimize
the first one.

#### 1 Week Later...

Your growth is continuing much faster than you could ever hope to optimize this
ruby code. The day you've hoped for and feared is upon you. Nothing else makes
any sense to tackle this problem.  

You have to re-write it.  
Ruby just won't cut it. 
Neither will JavaScript, Neither will python.  
Java probably won't either, too much memory usage there.   
Go would work for the current traffic levels, but when will your growth stop?  
No, you need as much performance as possible. 

## Rust or C++?
What do you have to reach for when you need to build something big and fast?
Right now, I currently have nothing, which is what I want to fix with Advent of
Code this year. In the situation I described above, really only 2 things make
sense in my head. C++ or Rust. I wouldn't want to fall back on my C knowledge
from university. I would take far too long making strings. 

So, which one did I choose? Let's break it down. 

## Criteria
This decision, like any other, is going to be about tradeoffs. We can't
evaluate these tradeoffs without first defining criteria for what is good and
what is bad. 

So, what is ideal in a fast non-garbage-collected language? 

1. Fast (or else we wouldn't be choosing this language)
2. Feature Complete (or else we couldn't choose this language)
3. Good Development Tooling
3. Usable in Industry
4. Prevents Errors

I'll explain the list briefly. 

### Fast
Now normally, I'm not a speed demon, and most of what I do doesn't need blazing
performance. However, these languages aren't for every use case. We're not
writing scripts with these languages, we're making things that require
performance. This is the category of languages that we _need_ to be fast. If
either Rust or C++ turns out to be not as fast as what we would expect, that
would disqualify them from being chosen. 

### Feature Complete
I have no desire to program in a language that cannot yet open files or work
effectively with strings.
Like speed, this is a disqualifying criteria. Any language without feature
completeness is not one I will be using for advent of code. 

### Good Development Tooling
I also have no desire to program in a language without a good debugger,
language server, IDE support, build system, package system, community-supported
packages, and the like. 

All of these make development fast. My hourly rate is very expensive, and I
want to deliver all that I can for that hourly rate. I don't want to spend
hours printf debugging when I could have spent 10 minutes in a debugging
session. 

Likewise, every time I get a red squiggly line in my editor telling me there 
is an error, it saves me a compile to check. Good updated packages served in a 
modern way are useful. Could you imagine writing a web backend from scratch in
ruby without rails? Me neither. 

### Usable by Industry
While I like learning just for the sake of learning, I also need to buy
groceries every month. For that reason, something that is used in industry is
important to me. You know, industry. The thing that pays us. We should listen
to what it wants at least some of the time (although we should tell it to move
on from Java 8.) The more something is used in industry, the more likely it is
that I will be paid for this skill. 

### Prevents Errors
I don't like writing bugs. It costs the company money in debugging and
remediation time, and it costs the company money in lost users. If the language
can prevent me from doing something stupid, I'll take it every day. 

As a side note, this is why I'm a fan of explicit static types, TDD, and null
safety. Any guarantee that my code doesn't have bugs I will take.  

For example, I think the very best feature of Kotlin is adding nullability to
the types in a way that makes a language that is nearly null-safe. I've written
too much java and fixed too many production `NullPointerException`'s to like
the concept of null.

## Rust Evaluation
First, let's evaluate Rust by these criteria. I'm not going to be assigning
hard numbers to these evaluations, after all this is just for advent of code.
If this was an evaluation I was proposing in a technical report, the structure
would be much more formal and the conclusions backed up with much more
empirical evidence.

### Rust's Speed
Rust is a statically compiled language with no garbage collection. 
It is fast. 

Looking at some benchmarks that I found online, Rust is comparable in speed 
to C (which is about as fast as code can go). 

Full benchmarks can be found here: 
[https://programming-language-benchmarks.vercel.app/c-vs-rust](https://programming-language-benchmarks.vercel.app/c-vs-rust)

In any case, 

### Rust's Feature Completeness
Rust is feature complete. There isn't anything that I need a programming
language to do that Rust cannot. 

### Rust's Development Tooling
Rust has some good development tooling. Rust can be easily installed with the
instructions at [https://rustup.rs/](https://rustup.rs/). It has a package
repository, [https://crates.io/](https://crates.io/), all managed by cargo, the
package manager, build tool, and test tool, rolled into one. It all even comes
with docs at [https://docs.rs/](https://docs.rs/)

There is a language server, rust analyzer, a formatter, rustfmt,  and ...
clippy?  

Yes, they brought back clippy, and made him into a linter. Those mad lads 
at Rust have been busy I guess. 

From what I can see, many of the most popular Rust crates (packages) are
actively maintained. This is very important for security reasons. Every
unmaintained package that your project takes on as a dependency is a potential
time bomb, and one that nobody else is going to defuse for you. 

Now, not that it's likely to matter for advent of code, since the programs are
so small, but I've seen online that compilation time for Rust is quite long. If
you're looking to build bigger programs with it, this is probably something
important to consider. 

Also, I can't see myself picking Rust for any embedded system right now, as 
the first tutorial I found for it seems to say that I need a nightly build of 
Rust and to clone some dude's GitHub repo just to make an Arduino uno work. 

The second tutorial I found targeted a different board and looks much more 
supported. However, I'm still not convinced that the amount of support 
needed for embedded systems design is there in Rust. 

### Rust's Industry Adoption
Rust has been getting some spotlight in recent months and years for the
adoption that it has been receiving in industry. It's still miles and miles
behind C++, but it's in the Linux kernel, it's in chrome, it's in the windows
kernel, it's in the alacritty terminal (that I use at home), it's in the warp
terminal (that I use at work), it's in AWS, Facebook, Cloudflare, and Discord.

Of course, many of those technologies are predominantly C++ or C, but I'm 
legitimately impressed at how many projects have at least tried a little bit
of Rust. It was more than I was expecting.  

While Rust doesn't get full marks here, I'm impressed.


### Rust's Error Prevention
Rust appears to have some decent error prevention built in to the language. 
It has memory safety as a design feature, and that is something rare in this
space, since neither C++ nor C can technically offer that. 

That's very appealing to me. It's one thing to say we should just be better 
programmers and not leak our memory or overrun buffers, but it's another thing
to admit that we are fallible as people, and design a language with policies 
that take that into account.

Rust also has null safety in the form of the Option type, instead of nullable 
types. I like that a lot too. 

I take cybersecurity very seriously, and memory safety issues make up a massive
number of the vulnerabilities listed each year. Don't believe me? 

ZDNet reported in 2019 that 70% of Microsoft's vulnerabilities were memory-related. 
How long has that trend lasted? 
  
12 years.

## C++ Evaluation

### C++'s Speed
Much like Rust, C++ is very close in speed to C's performance. 
[https://programming-language-benchmarks.vercel.app/cpp-vs-c](https://programming-language-benchmarks.vercel.app/cpp-vs-c)


### C++'s Feature Completeness
C++ has been feature complete for a while now, and they keep adding features to
it. Specifically, modern C++ (C++11 and later) has a lot of features that fix
previous problems with using the language. For example, they've implemented new
ways to manage memory, such as smart pointers and move semantics. They've also
added a lot of quality of life things, such as for-each loops, lambdas, type
inferencing, and a new threading library.

### C++'s Development Tooling
I was a little bit surprised at C++'s tooling. I was under the impression that
there wasn't much more than make and Cmake. However, there are package
managers, such as conan, vcpkg, and several others. There are at least 8
different compilers, 6 debuggers with several frontends for some of them,
several sanitizers, a few linters, many profilers, some unit testing
frameworks, great IDE support, LSP support, and more. 

While there isn't a monopoly in any of these features like there is in Rust, 
there are many options to choose from, allowing for a programmer to choose
exactly what tooling matters to them. 

Overall, I'm impressed, good job C++. 

### C++'s Industry Adoption
C++ is in everything and it is everywhere. It's in game engines, MS office,
photoshop, compilers, databases, the windows operating system, everything that
runs fast. 

If we were judging programming languages on their adoption alone, C++ might
very well be the greatest language of all time.  


### C++'s Error Prevention
While C++ has made great strides in preventing errors with newer features like
for each loops and unique pointers, it still isn't perfect. 

Specifically, there are still a lot of ways that you can still corrupt memory
in C++, even using all the modern features. They're loads better than old C++
sure, but the guarantees just aren't as strong. 


## Evaluation
Before I get into my summary and what I chose, I just want to say that both of
these languages are super strong and I'm impressed with both of them. I'm
impressed with Rust's attempt to start fresh with a new memory model and modern
features, and I'm impressed with C++'s ability to add features to address
problems while maintaining backwards compatibility. Both of these are good
languages, and I can understand why anyone would want to use either one. I have
all the respect that a programmer can for both of these languages, and the
people that choose them to build their products.

Here we can see speed compared between C++ and Rust: 
[https://programming-language-benchmarks.vercel.app/cpp-vs-rust](https://programming-language-benchmarks.vercel.app/cpp-vs-rust)
Both are super close to each other, with most tests being within a few ms of 
each other. Both are plenty fast, so let's look at the other criteria. 

Like speed, both Rust and C++ are what I would consider to be feature complete.
Neither one of those criteria are what I expected to make this decision based
on, but it's good to have some "disqualifying criteria" as a sanity check when
making decisions. If your disqualifying criteria aren't met, you cannot choose
that option.

In development tooling, things get a little more interesting. Before
researching this blog post, I would have thought rust would have won here hands
down because of the ecosystem, however, it looks like C++ has made real strides
here. There are lots of options for any development tooling I could want, so
I'm going to announce this category a draw. 

Next, industry adoption. This isn't even close, C++ is by far the winner here.
That being said, it looks like rust is being adopted in a lot of very big and
very famous C/C++ projects, like chrome and the Linux, and it looks like a lot
of companies are experimenting with it in smaller greenfield projects as a
replacement for C++. I didn't know industry was that far along in adopting
Rust. It still can't compete with C++, but it's no longer so early days that I
would feel bad about running Rust in my tech stack for a new project.

Lastly, we have error prevention. Again, coming into this article I had a very
different idea of what this section would have looked like.  I didn't know how
many strides modern C++ had made to make errors easier to catch. Unique
pointers, smart pointers, for each loops, coroutines, and more have been added
to help developers reason about the more thorny aspects of the language. While
some people might cringe at the bloat, I applaud this effort to make the
language safer and nicer without breaking backwards compatibility.

So, just to recap, speed, feature completeness, and development tooling are all
a tie in my books. C++ wins for industry adoption, though by a smaller margin
than I expected, and Rust wins for error prevention, though again by a smaller
margin than I expected. 

However, that doesn't mean that it's a tie, it just means we get to choose what
is more important to us: industry adoption or error prevention. 

Let's look at industry in my city, Vancouver. Searching for rust developer jobs
on indeed shows 25 results, and almost all of those are along the lines of
"must have knowledge in 1 of the following languages: C, C++, Golang, Rust,
python, Java."  A few are for rust jobs, but not many. 

In contrast, C++ shows 391 jobs, and the first few that I look at are listed as
being a C++ developer explicitly.

25 < 391

## The Winner
For me, someone who is looking to grow their employable skills in the software
industry, C++ is the winner, and that's the language I will be using for 
Advent of Code this year. 

## Closing Thoughts
In the end, I chose C++ because it has such a strangle hold over industry.
While doing my analysis, I learned that these two languages are much closer to
feature parity with each other than I had previously thought. 

I wouldn't have felt bad choosing Rust either, and based on everything that I
read, I wouldn't be surprised if in the next few years you start to see massive
numbers of rust positions open up in industry. 

Imagine you're planning a new project at your workplace, and you do all the
analysis that I did, and you see that Rust is basically a slightly less
error-prone C++ with a slower compiler. It's super loved and super hyped, so
finding people that are at least decent with the language shouldn't be that
hard - just post on twitter and watch the job applications roll in. That would
be a very convincing argument to use it in your next project. I think that's
very likely what is going to happen in the next few years, and I think you'll
see a lot of technical designers choosing rust for those reasons. 

So why did I choose C++ and not Rust, you may be asking. If that's your grand
prediction for the language after taking the hours to research and write about
the language, why wouldn't you make a bet on your future instead of your
present? 

And the answer, dear reader, is a simple one: I'm human and thus horrendously
bad at predicting the future. My confidence rating in my prediction is 20% at
the highest. It's the same reason that I design my software for today's
problems, and do very little to optimize for tomorrow's uncertain requirements.
The road to hell is paved with premature optimization, and for me, learning
Rust this year would be premature optimization. 

See y'all on the advent of code leaderboards!
